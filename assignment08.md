Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Project Description
My project is based on the Los Angeles Animal Services website, which serves as the first point of contact for many individuals across Los Angeles County looking to adopt, foster, or surrender a pet. The primary uses of the Los Angeles Animal Services website are for volunteer sign-up, fostering, and adoption, which are the key aspects of the site that my project focuses on.

My project emphasizes ways that community members can contribute to local animal services, namely: volunteering, fostering, and adoption. My user research demonstrated that the Los Angeles Animal Services website's lack of intuitive design acts as a barrier to community members wishing to get involved with the shelters. The website acts at a platform to increase awareness about ethical means of surrending pets (as opposed to abandonment) as well as educate community members about pet adoption and fostering options, volunteering opportunities, and more. Through my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I discovered that it is very difficult and unintuitive for users to interact with important features of the site, which is a major issue that I hope to solve through my project.

The purpose of this high-fidelity interactive prototyping is to create a functional representation of my design based on the initial low-fidelity prototype and its feedback. By mapping out a detailed version of the different screens of the website and using a prototyping tool to implement a navigation flow, I can test how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This allows me to observe the user behavior and make adjustments to my design before presenting a final product.

The prototype demonstrates three key tasks: (1) search for and filter through available pets, (2) bookmark a pet of interest and access bookmarked as well as recently viewed pets, and (3) view notifications related to pets of interest.
