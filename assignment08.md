# Interactive Prototype
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Project Description
My project is based on the Los Angeles Animal Services website, which serves as the first point of contact for many individuals across Los Angeles County looking to adopt, foster, or surrender a pet. The primary uses of the Los Angeles Animal Services website are for volunteer sign-up, fostering, and adoption, which are the key aspects of the site that my project focuses on.

My project emphasizes ways that community members can contribute to local animal services, namely: volunteering, fostering, and adoption. My user research demonstrated that the Los Angeles Animal Services website's lack of intuitive design acts as a barrier to community members wishing to get involved with the shelters. The website acts at a platform to increase awareness about ethical means of surrending pets (as opposed to abandonment) as well as educate community members about pet adoption and fostering options, volunteering opportunities, and more. Through my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I discovered that it is very difficult and unintuitive for users to interact with important features of the site, which is a major issue that I hope to solve through my project.

The purpose of this high-fidelity interactive prototyping is to create a functional representation of my design based on the initial low-fidelity prototype and its feedback. By mapping out a detailed version of the different screens of the website and using a prototyping tool to implement a navigation flow, I can test how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This allows me to observe the user behavior and make adjustments to my design before presenting a final product.

The prototype demonstrates three key tasks: (1) search for and filter through available pets, (2) bookmark a pet of interest and access bookmarked as well as recently viewed pets, and (3) view notifications related to pets of interest.

### Graphic Design
I used Figma to convert my screen designs from the low-fidelity prototype to a digital platform. I did not make the interactive prototype too detailed as my user personas and earlier research indicated that the major issue with the adoption search tool was in regards to functionality and basic navigation rather than key details. Thus, I focused on showing the opportunities for navigation (buttons, links, icons) instead of the contents of text or images. Some considerations I made in my decision to select specific colors, fonts, etc. included the current Los Angeles Animal Services logo (composed of white and blue), the current Los Angeles Animal Services website (grey and navy blue), and the readibility of different texts and graphical components.

In addition to considering the existing color scheme, I also wanted to make my design accessible. Thus, I considered the contrast between the foreground and background colors such that my design met the required WCAG 2 Contrast Ratio for AA compliance, the ideal level for most non-specialized websites. Using the A11y Color Contrast Checker plugin on Figma, I confirmed that all of my screen designs met the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

### Wireflow
I used the prototyping tool in Figma to map out the navigation flow between the different screen designs. The complete interaction sequences shown using arrow lines include: searching for and filtering through available pets, bookmarking a pet of interest and accessing bookmarked as well as recently viewed pets, and viewing notifications related to pets of interest.
