# Low Fidelity Prototype
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Project Description
My project is based on the Los Angeles Animal Services website, which serves as the first point of contact for many individuals across Los Angeles County looking to adopt, foster, or surrender a pet. The primary uses of the Los Angeles Animal Services website are for volunteer sign-up, fostering, and adoption, which are the key aspects of the site that my project focuses on.

My project emphasizes ways that community members can contribute to local animal services, namely: volunteering, fostering, and adoption. My user research demonstrated that the Los Angeles Animal Services website's lack of intuitive design acts as a barrier to community members wishing to get involved with the shelters. The website acts at a platform to increase awareness about ethical means of surrending pets (as opposed to abandonment) as well as educate community members about pet adoption and fostering options, volunteering opportunities, and more. Through my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I discovered that it is very difficult and unintuitive for users to interact with important features of the site, which is a major issue that I hope to solve through my project.

I created three user personas to represent possible users of the Los Angeles Animal Services website. Karen is a mom who is interested in using the Los Angeles Animal Services website to adopt a pet for her family. Karen wants to find pets that match her desired features and keep track of the pets she is interested in adopting so that she can show her family. Jamie is a single lady who is interested in using the Los Angeles Animal Services website to foster a pet. Jamie wants to easily find the information she is looking for and will not feel overwhelmed when viewing the website. Liam is a graduate student and researcher who is interested in signing up to volunter at a Los Angeles Animal Services shelter on the weekends with his girlfriend. He wants to fill out the volunteering sign-up form in his free time without feeling overwhelmed.

Based on these three user personas, I decided to hone in on the most impactful aspect of the website: the adoption search tool. With the adoption search tool, I selected three key features that would benefit many users if implemented: a more extensive filter option, a bookmark and history feature, and a notification system. The more extensive filter feature would allow users to input additional preferences for their pet more easily. The bookmark and history feature would allow users to keep track of which pets they've previously viewed and which pets they are interested in. The notification system would allow users to learn when certain pets become available or have important updates. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to create an initial concept of the website design, testing functionality through user interaction. By creating a rough sketch of the different screens of the website and the navigation flow between them, I can observe how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This enables me to better understand the thought process of the users and adjust my design to be more intuitive for them.
