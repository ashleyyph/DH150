# Low Fidelity Prototype
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Project Description
My project is based on the Los Angeles Animal Services website, which serves as the first point of contact for many individuals across Los Angeles County looking to adopt, foster, or surrender a pet. The primary uses of the Los Angeles Animal Services website are for volunteer sign-up, fostering, and adoption, which are the key aspects of the site that my project focuses on.

My project emphasizes ways that community members can contribute to local animal services, namely: volunteering, fostering, and adoption. My user research demonstrated that the Los Angeles Animal Services website's lack of intuitive design acts as a barrier to community members wishing to get involved with the shelters. The website acts at a platform to increase awareness about ethical means of surrending pets (as opposed to abandonment) as well as educate community members about pet adoption and fostering options, volunteering opportunities, and more. Through my heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I discovered that it is very difficult and unintuitive for users to interact with important features of the site, which is a major issue that I hope to solve through my project.

I created three user personas to represent possible users of the Los Angeles Animal Services website. Karen is a mom who is interested in using the Los Angeles Animal Services website to adopt a pet for her family. Karen wants to find pets that match her desired features and keep track of the pets she is interested in adopting so that she can show her family. Jamie is a single lady who is interested in using the Los Angeles Animal Services website to foster a pet. Jamie wants to easily find the information she is looking for and will not feel overwhelmed when viewing the website. Liam is a graduate student and researcher who is interested in signing up to volunter at a Los Angeles Animal Services shelter on the weekends with his girlfriend. He wants to fill out the volunteering sign-up form in his free time without feeling overwhelmed.

Based on these three user personas, I decided to hone in on the most impactful aspect of the website: the adoption search tool. With the adoption search tool, I selected three key features that would benefit many users if implemented: a more extensive filter option, a bookmark and history feature, and a notification system. The more extensive filter feature would allow users to input additional preferences for their pet more easily. The bookmark and history feature would allow users to keep track of which pets they've previously viewed and which pets they are interested in. The notification system would allow users to learn when certain pets become available or have important updates. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to create an initial concept of the website design, testing functionality through user interaction. By creating a rough sketch of the different screens of the website and the navigation flow between them, I can observe how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This enables me to better understand the thought process of the users and adjust my design to be more intuitive for them.

### Wireframes

### Wireflow
The wireflow shows the possible interaction sequences of the screens, emphasizing the three key features of: (1) improved and expanded filter feature, (2) bookmark and history feature, and (3) notification feature.

### Testing
The tester was able to complete three key tasks related to the introduced/improved features: (1) search for and filter through available pets, (2) bookmark a pet of interest and access bookmarked as well as recently viewed pets, and (3) view notifications related to pets of interest.

### Reflection
Beginning the process of low-fidelity prototyping, I felt a bit overwhelmed as the features I wanted to introduce were completely new, and I had to consider how I would integrate them into the existing interface. I began with the home page of the adoption search tool and branched off from there. First, I created the header as I thought it was key to navigating the new features of the tool. I struggled a bit with this part because I was unsure of which screens to include in the header. Then, I created the results page as I thought it was the most important output of the tool. I introduced the new filter design, which took me a few iterations to come up with as it was completely different from the existing design. Last, I created the notification, bookmark, and history pages. These also took me a while because they were also built from my imagination rather than the existing design, but I tried to keep the appearance consistent across the three screens to make the user experience more intuitive. Because I decided to create a brand new design, I was not able to reference the existing design of the Los Angeles Animal Services website and had to choose my own style.

Based on the results of my testing, I believe that there are two key areas to hone in on:
1. Some of the wireflows lead to a different destination than what the user expected. If I were to revise the prototype, I would flesh out and add wireframes that more accurately represent where a button or link should direct to. For example, on the bookmarks page, clicking on a pet leads to the results page. A better wireframe to direct to could be an individual pet page. I would also add clearer back and cancel navigation, which is very important for a site such as LAAS that has search and filter tools. 
2. Some of the design features were unclear in whether they could be clicked on or not, and if so, where they would lead. If I were to revise the prototype, I would add indicators (e.g., underlines or hover highlights) that would allow the user to determine whether or not they could click on something. In addition, I would create additional wireframes and rename some of my existing buttons and links to reflect where they would lead.
