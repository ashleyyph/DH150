### Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Karen Uses Adoptable Pet Search Feature
When looking into pet adoption, people often do not begin with a clear idea of what kind of pet they would like. They want to be able to both browse the existing catalog of available pets, keep track of pets they're interested in, and conduct further research on those pets. Currently, people consult their local animal shelters' websites, visit the physical shelters, or call the shelters. The user is frustrated because there is no clear way to organize all of the information they learn while browsing and gathering details. The user can only use a limited number of filters when searching, and there is no way for the user to keep track of what pets they have viewed and are interested in, or what pets are not at the shelter but they would be interested in being notified once available. To solve this problem, Los Angeles Animal Services should refine their filter and search options to have several toggles indicating additional key features, including but not limited to: breed, specific age, weight, shelter location, hypoallergenic nature, etc. Los Angeles Animal Services should also implement a way for users to back navigate (clear filters and redo search more easily), bookmark pets of interest, and set up notifications when pets become available for adoption. These features would be very beneficial to users, allowing them to refine their searches such that only the pets they're specifically interested in appear, to keep track of pets they like when browsing the catalog such that they can easily return to their pages to find more information, and to learn when a pet they're interested in adopting becomes available such that they can quickly move to the next step of the adoption process. This scenario applies to user personas like Karen, who are looking for specific features in their future pets.

Karen is interested in adopting a pet for her family. At the start of the process, she had no idea what her preferences were and browsed the Los Angeles Animal Services website. Now, she has a more specific idea of characteristics she's interested in and would like to find a suitable pet. She clicks on the 'Adoptable Pet Search' feature from the home screen. She selects 'Dog' under 'Animal Type', 'Male' under 'Gender', 'More than 1 year' under 'Animal Age', and 'Medium' under 'Animal Size'. With her search filled out, she clicks the 'Search Now' button. She can see which pets fit her criteria, as well as information on their picture, ID, description, weight, age, and location. By clicking on a specific pet's feature, she can see adoption information, can view the phone number for the shelter, and email the information to a friend.

### Karen's User Journey

##### Challenges
* Karen has several criteria she is interested in for her pet, that are not available as filter options in the search.
* Karen feels like she has seen pets of interest before, but because there is no way to save or bookmark previously viewed pets, she is not sure which ones they were and does not have time to go through all of the results again.
* Karen might not find a pet she is interested in and not know what to do.

##### Solution
* Additional filters can be added to the search for more preference options. Existing filters can also be expanded to include multiple options, making the system more flexible and tailored to the user.
* A bookmark or save feature can be added to help users keep track of previously viewed pets of interest.
* A notification system can be added to let Karen know when a pet that matches her criteria becomes available for adoption.

##### Implementation
* Karen will be able to find pets that match her desired features, as well as be notified when a pet of those features becomes available for adoption.
* Karen will be able to keep track of the pets she is interested in adopting so that she can show her family and schedule visits accordingly.

## Scenario 2: Jamie Uses Foster Resources Feature
When first joining a cause or organization, it can be helpful for people to view available resources to better understand their new role and responsibilities. They want these resources to be well-organized and accessible so that they can be easily digested. Currently, people consult the resources tab or page of the website of their organization to view resources. The user is frustrated because the information is not clearly organized, so the user does not know where to look for specific types of information. To solve this problem, Los Angeles Animal Services should invest in the reorganization and fleshing out of its existing resources pages to be more comprehensive. This scenario applies to user personas like Jamie, who are looking for information about helping out a community organization.

### Jamie's User Journey
Jamie is interested in fostering a pet. She has fostered pets before and has experience, but has never fostered a pet from Los Angeles Animal Services. Now, she has conducted some research and is interested in learning more information about fostering a pet from Los Angeles Animal Services. She clicks on the 'Foster Program' feature from the home screen. She can see what types of pets are available for fostering, what the typical expectations of a foster pet parent are, see handbooks for foster pet care, and access the foster application by clicking through several tabs and scrolling.

##### Challenges
* Jamie is curious about certain things (e.g., what specific pets are available for fostering) that are not available on the page.
* Jamie struggles to find the information she is interested in because of the poor organization of the tabs in addition to the excessively long paragraphs of information.

##### Solution
* Additional information can be added to supplement the basic resources such that the page is more comprehensive; what type of information can be determined from surveying users.
* The page can be reorganized to make it more modular, more easy to navigate, and more easy to read for users.

##### Implementation
* Jamie will be able to access all of the information she is interested in by viewing the resources page, with no additional need to conduct research outside of the website.
* Jamie will be able to easily find the information she is looking for and will not feel overwhelmed when viewing the page.
