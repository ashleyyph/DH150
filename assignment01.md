# Animal Adoption Design Project

Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Description of Community
The community that I would like to contribute to with my design is the animal adoption and fostering community.
For the past few months, I have been volunteering at a local animal shelter (No Kill Los Angeles). This has been a
very impactful experience for me as I've worked closely with cats and dogs who have been mistreated or abandoned by their
owners. The health and care issues these pets face are largely a result of unethical private breeding, lack of awareness about
adoption benefits, and several other factors. Thus, I would like to improve the design of existing animal adoption websites
to increase awareness about pet adoption and facilitate the adoption process, as well as encourage people to get involved and volunteer at shelters.

### Selected Websites
***Website 1:** No Kill Los Angeles*

No Kill Los Angeles (NKLA) is an initiative that brings together passionate volunteers, city shelters and a coalition of animal welfare organizations to end the killing of dogs and cats in shelters throughout Los Angeles. The NKLA website provides information on how to get involved with volunteering at the pet adoption center, how to adopt a pet, and how to donate to the organization.

I decided to complete a heuristic evaluation of the NKLA website because I believe that the organization serves an important purpose in preventing the cruel, unethical treatment and euthanization of homeless pets across Los Angeles County. I feel that a redesign of the website could help to increase awareness about NKLA's mission and encourage more adoptions by the community.

***Website 2:** Los Angeles Animal Services*

The City of Los Angeles Animal Services Department (LAAS) operates six award-winning animal shelters and has both staff and volunteers serving the local community, caring for 60,000 animals and responding to 20,000 emergency calls each year. The LAAS website provides information on how to visit each of its shelters, how to attend its adoption and fostering events, how to care for adopted and fostered pets, how to properly bring pets and report emergencies to the center, how to get involved with the organization, and how to donate.

I decided to complete a heuristic evaluation of the LAAS website because I believe that the organization serves as the first point of contact for many individuals across Los Angeles County looking to adopt or surrender a pet. I feel that a redesign of the website could help to increase awareness about ethical means of surrending pets (as opposed to abandonment) as well as educate community members about pet adoption and fostering options, important veterinary and home care tips for pets, and more.
