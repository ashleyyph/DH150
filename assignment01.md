# Animal Adoption Design Project

Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Description of Community
The community that I would like to contribute to with my design is the animal adoption and fostering community.
For the past few months, I have been volunteering at a local animal shelter (No Kill Los Angeles). This has been a
very impactful experience for me as I've worked closely with cats and dogs who have been mistreated or abandoned by their
owners. The health and care issues these pets face are largely a result of unethical private breeding, lack of awareness about
adoption benefits, and several other factors. Thus, I would like to improve the design of existing animal adoption websites
to increase awareness about pet adoption and facilitate the adoption process.
