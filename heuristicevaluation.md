# Heuristic Evaluation
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### 1. Visibility of system status
Good. Prototype shows visibility of system status and keeps users informed about what is going on in three key ways:
* When a pet has been selected on the search page, its preview bio is highlighted in white.
* When notifications are turned on for a pet, its notification symbol is filled in. 
* When a filter is selected, it changes to a filled in color. 

### 2. Match between system and the real world
Good. Prototype uses important icons that match between system and the real world, making the system appear familiar to the user, in three key ways:
* Notification symbol mimics a bell, which is used to alert people in the real world.
* Bookmark symbol mimics a physical bookmark, which is used to keep track of things in the real world.
* History symbol mimics a rewind icon and clock, which are both used to indicate past time in the real world.

### 3. User control and freedom
Good. Prototype includes features that offer the user control and freedom over their search and navigation process, including "emergency exit" undo and redo options, in two key ways:
* Filter and sort options offer user control and freedom over search results.
* Back button allows users control and freedom over navigation.

### 4. Consistency and standards
Good. Styles including fonts, colors, and icons are consistent across screen designs such that users do not have to wonder whether different words, icons, or buttons mean the same thing. Slight mismatch between sharpness of different design elements (e.g., rounded corners of search bar versus sharp corners of search results).

### 5. Error prevention
Bad. Prototype does not include error prevention for issues such as:
* Search irrelevant keywords that do not produce results.
* View map area outside of animal services coverage.

### 6. Recognition rather than recall
Good. Prototype includes features that support recognition rather than recall, such as giving filter and sort options. Minimizes the user's memory load by making options and actions visible. Potential keyword results should be added to the search bar to improve this heuristic.

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
Good. Navigation between screens in prototype is easily identifiable through use of representative icons and back buttons. Navigation is also efficient, with multipe and flexible ways to move between screens such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
Good. Prototype design is uncluttered and does not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Bad. Prototype does not included error messages for unprevented errors such as:
* Search irrelevant keywords that do not produce results.
* View map area outside of animal services coverage.

### 10. Help and documentation
Neutral. Based on previous testing, system appears to be easily usable by new users without help and documentation. In the future, adding a feature to provide help and documentation may be helpful for certain users.
