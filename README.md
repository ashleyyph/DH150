# Los Angeles Animal Services | Ashley Phuong

### Introduction
The community that I would like to contribute to with my design is the animal adoption and fostering community. For the past few months, I have been volunteering at a local animal shelter (No Kill Los Angeles). This has been a very impactful experience for me as I've worked closely with cats and dogs who have been mistreated or abandoned by their owners. The health and care issues these pets face are largely a result of unethical private breeding, lack of awareness about adoption benefits, and several other factors. Thus, I would like to improve the design of existing animal adoption websites to increase awareness about pet adoption and facilitate the adoption process, as well as encourage people to get involved and volunteer at shelters.

### Design Statement
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

### Competitor Analysis
Animal care and services is a very important issue to me. Thus, I selected two animal services website that offer valuable tools and resources (e.g., adoption search, fostering search, volunteer registration) providing important information about how to visitshelters, how to attend adoption and fostering events, how to care for adopted and fostered pets, how to properly surrender pets and report emergencies, how to get involved with the organizations, and how to donate.

### User Research
I conducted user research in order to develop a stronger understanding of the userâ€™s goals and the context about the user's actions (what, why, and how of their behavior). In my contextual inquiry, I asked the user (an individual interested in animal services and pet adoption) to complete a task related to searching for adoption information through the Los Angeles Animal Services website. The existing methods for acquiring pet adoption information are: (1) to browse animal services websites online or (2) contact or visit local animal shelters directly. There are several animal services websites for the Los Angeles community, such as No Kill Los Angeles, Los Angeles Animal Services, spcaLA, and more. As a volunteer and advocate for animal services and pet adoption, I found it interesting to detach myself from the process and observe how another user interacted with the website during the user testing.

### UX Storytelling
As I developed my UX storytelling, I began to think about the types of people my system is intended to support. I created three user personas that represented the target demographic of my design solution.

Based on my user personas and other considerations I thought about since the start of the project, I created three scenarios that demonstrated the envisioned functionality of the design features I planned to introduce. 
* Scenario #1: Use adoptable pet search feature to find adoption information
* Scenario #2: Use foster resources feature to learn how to foster a pet
* Scenario #3: Use volunteer sign-up feature to begin the involvement process

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
Through my user research and testing, I discovered that it is very difficult and unintuitive for users to interact with important features of the Los Angeles Animal Services website, which was a major issue that I hoped to fix through my design solution. Based on the three user personas I created, I decided to focus on the most impactful aspect of the website: the adoption search tool. Read more about my initial wireframes and wireflow in my low-fidelity prototype [here](https://github.com/ashleyyph/DH150/blob/master/assignment06.md).

I also evaluated the accessibility of the Los Angeles Animal Services website, proposed three color variations of background and text, and checked the color contrast of my variations to meet WCAG2.1 AA compliance. Learn more about my accessibility audit and graphic design element variation [here](https://github.com/ashleyyph/DH150/tree/master/assignment07). 

After I sketched out and tested the wireframes, wireflow, and graphic design element variations for my design solution features, I transferred my work to a digital platform. Below are some of the screens I designed based on my low-fidelity prototype and feedback from user testing.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
I created a low-fidelity prototype in order to map out an initial concept of the website design, testing functionality through user interaction. By creating a rough sketch of the different screens of the website and the navigation flow between them, I was able to observe how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This allowed me to better understand the thought process of the users and adjust my design to be more intuitive for them.

### High-Fidelity Prototype 
I created a high-fidelity prototype in order to create a functional representation of my design based on my initial low-fidelity prototype and the feedback I received through testing and cognitive walkthrough. By mapping out a detailed version of the different screens of the website and using a prototyping tool to implement a navigation flow, I was able to test how users interact with the site features and identify the reasons behind their behavior. This allowed me to observe the user behavior and make adjustments to my design before presenting a final product.

### Optional Evaluation and Revision History
After I created my high-fidelity prototype, I conducted a heuristic evaluation and usability test in order to identify the top three potential heuristic issues that I wanted to check with users whether they would feel challenging or unsatisfactory to complete, and based on those issues, I developed three tasks for the user to complete. 
* Task #1: Search for and filter through available pets
* Task #2: Bookmark a pet of interest and access bookmarked as well as recently viewed pets
* Task #3: View notifications related to pets of interest

After this additional user testing, I revised my design solution based on the feedback I received and conducted another accessibility audit to ensure that my design was still effective and comprehensive.
