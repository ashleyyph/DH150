# Los Angeles Animal Services | Ashley Phuong

### Introduction
The community that I would like to contribute to with my design is the animal adoption and fostering community. For the past few months, I have been volunteering at a local animal shelter (No Kill Los Angeles). This has been a very impactful experience for me as I've worked closely with cats and dogs who have been mistreated or abandoned by their owners. The health and care issues these pets face are largely a result of unethical private breeding, lack of awareness about adoption benefits, and several other factors. Thus, I would like to improve the design of existing animal adoption websites to increase awareness about pet adoption and facilitate the adoption process, as well as encourage people to get involved and volunteer at shelters.

### Design Statement
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

### Competitor Analysis
Animal care and services is a very important issue to me. Thus, I selected two animal services website that offer valuable tools and resources (e.g., adoption search, fostering search, volunteer registration) providing important information about how to visitshelters, how to attend adoption and fostering events, how to care for adopted and fostered pets, how to properly surrender pets and report emergencies, how to get involved with the organizations, and how to donate.

Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product(s) - or the original website you evaluated (assignment 01 + 02)

### User Research
I conducted user research in order to develop a stronger understanding of the userâ€™s goals and the context about the user's actions (what, why, and how of their behavior). In my contextual inquiry, I asked the user (an individual interested in animal services and pet adoption) to complete a task related to searching for adoption information through the Los Angeles Animal Services website. The existing methods for acquiring pet adoption information are: (1) to browse animal services websites online or (2) contact or visit local animal shelters directly. There are several animal services websites for the Los Angeles community, such as No Kill Los Angeles, Los Angeles Animal Services, spcaLA, and more. As a volunteer and advocate for animal services and pet adoption, I found it interesting to detach myself from the process and observe how another user interacted with the website during the user testing.

### UX Storytelling
As I developed my UX storytelling, I began to think about the types of people my system is intended to support. I created three user personas that represented the target demographic of my design solution.

Based on my user personas and other considerations I thought about since the start of the project, I created three scenarios that demonstrated the envisioned functionality of the design features I planned to introduce. 
* Scenario #1: Use adoptable pet search feature to find adoption information
* Scenario #2: Use foster resources feature to learn how to foster a pet
* Scenario #3: Use volunteer sign-up feature to begin the involvement process

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment07)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history) (assignment 07 + part of 08)

### High-Fidelity Prototype 
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype (assignment 08)

### Optional Evaluation and Revision History
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
