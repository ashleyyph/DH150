# Contextual Inquiry - LA Animal Services
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Design Challenge
The main activity that my project would support is the adoption process for pets.
I am interested in seeing how technology can encourage outreach about animal rights
and services, assist research about animal shelters and adoption options, and 
facilitate the adoption process for interested individuals. 

The basic need involved for this activity is self-actualization. The adoption of a pet
(and subsequent care) give way to the pursuit of goals related to pet parenting, which
may include providing a healthy, safe home environment or teaching fun pet tricks.

The current solution to adopt a pet is to browse the animal services website online and/or
contact local animal shelters directly to visit and thus begin the adoption process.

The limitations that would possibly be improved with digital technology include the 
filtering system personalized to the individual's adoption preferences (such as age, 
breed, and gender), notification system to alert the individual of updates in the
adoption process, initial online application to inform the individual of their adoption
eligibility and necessary steps before visiting the shelter, and more.


### Target Users
Users are adults above the age of 18 looking to adopt a pet. Users may or may not have
a pet (or have had a pet), and have conducted appropriate research related to pet
adoption and ownership already. 

Users tend to browse the website and explore adoption options in the comfort of their home,
perhaps alongside family members and/or friends who live with them and are thus also
invested in the adoption process.

To complete the activity, users first access the pet adoption search page and input their
desired traits for a pet, if any. Users then browse the results generated by the search
engine and its consideration of their preferences. Once the user selects a pet they are 
interested in adopting, they proceed to call the provided phone number and schedule a visit
to the appropriate animal shelter to begin the adoption process.


### Research Method
The contextual inquiry is a direct interview that takes place in a residence hall at UCLA. 
The participant is a college student whose family has been considering the adoption of a pet
in recent months. I use my laptop to record the audio of the interview, while observing how 
the participant interacts with the website throughout the task and encouraging them to share
their thought processes.
