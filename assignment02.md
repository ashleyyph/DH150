# Pilot Usability Test - LA Animal Services 
Ashley Phuong | DH150: User Experience and Design

### Purpose
The purpose of the pilot usability test was to measure the usability (efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction) of the LA Animal Services Website by collecting empirical data and observing a representative end user while they used the website to perform some realistic tasks. Based on my heuristic evaluation, I chose the three issues that I wanted to check whether the user would feel were challenging to complete, or unsatisfactory and inefficient. Specifically, I was interested in testing the processes of (1) searching for information, (2) navigating to different pages, and (3) filling out forms according to my evaluation of the user control and freedom, flexibility and efficiency of use, and aesthetic and minimalist design heuristics. In order to help my usability test participant be properly engaged in the context of use, I thought of three scenarios in which the user might face these issues: (1) finding adoption information, (2) researching pet care tips, and (3) signing up for volunteering opportunities.

### Comments
During the pilot test, I learned that the user actually did experience many of the issues I identified in my heuristic evaluation. Specifically, the user found it difficult to use the search bar, navigate between pages, and complete the volunteer sign-up process. Overall, I thought the usability test went well. The recording of the video and screen, filling out of the questionnaire, and observing of the interactions all went very smoothly. The only part that I believe did not go so well and could be improved on was my audio guidance for the user. At times, I felt as though I was not providing enough instruction or affirmation for the user.
